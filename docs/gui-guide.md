## How to Use

### Building and Running

```bash
# Build (GUI mode by default)
make build

# Run GUI (default mode)
./jaqen

# Or run directly
go run .
```

### CLI Mode Alternative

If you prefer the command-line interface:

```bash
# Run CLI mode
./jaqen cli

# Or build CLI-only version
make build-cli
./jaqen cli
```

### GUI Workflow

1. **Select Files**
   - Click "Browse..." next to XML Config File to select your `config.xml`
   - Click "Browse..." next to RTF Player File to select your `newgen.rtf`
   - Click "Browse..." next to Image Directory to select your facepack folder

2. **Configure Options**
   - Check "Preserve existing mappings" if you want to keep current assignments
   - Check "Allow duplicate images" if you want to reuse images
   - Select your Football Manager version from the dropdown

3. **Process Files**
   - Click "Process Files" to start the face mapping
   - Watch the progress bar and status updates
   - Wait for completion confirmation

4. **Optional: Format Config**
   - If you have a TOML config file, use "Format Config" to clean it up

## Technical Details

### Build Tags
The project uses Go build tags to conditionally compile:
- **Default version**: `go build .` (includes GUI, launches GUI by default)
- **CLI-only version**: `go build -tags cli .` (CLI-only, no GUI dependencies)

### Dependencies
- **Fyne v2.6.3** - Modern Go GUI framework
- **sqweek/dialog** - Native file dialog library for true OS integration
- **Cross-platform** - Works on Windows, macOS, and Linux
- **Native performance** - Uses system-native widgets and file dialogs

### File Structure
```
cmd/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ gui.go          # GUI implementation
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ root.go         # CLI commands (includes GUI command)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ format.go       # Config formatting

main.go             # CLI entry point
main_gui.go         # GUI entry point (build tag)
```

## Benefits Over CLI

- **No command-line knowledge required** - perfect for casual users
- **Visual feedback** - see exactly what's happening during processing
- **Error prevention** - file validation before processing starts
- **Easy configuration** - checkboxes and dropdowns instead of flags
- **Progress tracking** - know how long operations will take
- **User-friendly** - intuitive interface for Football Manager players

The GUI maintains all the power and flexibility of the CLI version while making it accessible to users who prefer graphical interfaces.
