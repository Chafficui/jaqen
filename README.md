# Jaqen

> This is very much work in progress.

A Football Manager New GAN Manager rewrite in go. I named it Jaqen based on Jaqen H'ghar having a wall of faces.

## Motivation

I just wanted to learn go and just found the original didn't run well on Linux, as I think the original version works pretty well for Windows and Mac. However, this is just a fun side project for me. Even if I finish this off, I don't intend on supporting it long term, you're very welcomed to submit PRs and Issues but I don't guarantee to fix it.

## Requirements

- Place the image folders under the called the folder `newgens/` inside the steam folder subdirectory for graphics for football manager.
- The XML file (if you have one) should also be placed under the same folder.
- The graphics folder path might look something like this: `$HOME/.local/share/Steam/steamapps/compatdata/{some number}/pfx/drive_c/users/steamuser/Documents/Sports Interactive/Football Manager 2021/graphics`

## Usage
