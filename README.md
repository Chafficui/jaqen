## Configuration

### Ethnic Group Mapping

The tool automatically maps Football Manager nations to ethnic groups:

| Ethnic Group | Code |
|--------------|------|
| African | African |
| Asian | Asian |
| Caucasian | Caucasian |
| Central European | Central European |
| Eastern European Central Asian | EECA |
| Italian Mediterranean | Italmed |
| Middle East North African | MENA |
| Middle East South Asian | MESA |
| South American Mediterranean | SAMed |
| Scandinavian | Scandinavian |
| South East Asian | Seasian |
| South American | South American |
| Spanish Mediterranean | SpanMed |
| Yugoslav Greek | YugoGreek |

### Custom Mappings

You can override default mappings in the settings:

```toml
[mapping_override]
AFG = 'MESA'  # Afghanistan ‚Üí Middle East South Asian
ENG = 'Caucasian'  # England ‚Üí Caucasian
```

## How It Works

1. **Parse RTF File** - Extracts player data (ID, nationality, ethnic group)
2. **Map Nations** - Converts nations to ethnic groups (with override support)
3. **Select Images** - Randomly selects images from appropriate ethnic directories
4. **Generate XML** - Creates Football Manager mapping file
5. **Update Config** - Writes updated config.xml for FM
