# Jaqen

A Football Manager New GAN Manager rewrite in go. I named it Jaqen based on Jaqen H'ghar having a wall of faces.

## Motivation

I just wanted to learn go and just found the original didn't run well on Linux, as I think the original version works pretty well for Windows and Mac so it's unnecessary to support those architectures.

## Usage

This is very much work in progress.
